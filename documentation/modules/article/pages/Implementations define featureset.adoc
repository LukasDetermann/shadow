= How can Implementations define the featureset?

This is the result of
xref:Shadow-Api:article:Meta Model.adoc[]
The goal was to change the metamodel Api in such a way that implementations can define the featureset.
So that ech Implementation can decide what e.g. a `Method` can do.

Goals in on order

- discoverability
- flexibility
- barrier of entry

== previous

[%linenums,java]
----
public interface Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> {

}

public interface Queryable {
   <TO_QUERY, RESULT> RESULT getOrThrow(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);

   <TO_QUERY, RESULT> Optional<RESULT> get(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);
}

public interface Shadow extends Queryable {
   @Override
   <TO_QUERY, RESULT> RESULT getOrThrow(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);

   @Override
   <TO_QUERY, RESULT> Optional<RESULT> get(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);
}
----
The only positive about this solution is, its communicates the intention very clearly on an Entityâ€“relationship model.
In practice this api would allow querying of anything on any Type.


== Static Getter

[%linenums,java]
----
public static String getName(Nameable nameable) {

}

static {
   Method method = null;

   String name = getName(method);
}
----
This is the simples possible solution.
It's just a static getter.
The discoverability is poor.
The caller has to know the type hierarchy to know that `getName()` can be called with methods.

`For this Object -> get the name` should be preferred over `get the name -> for this Object`
Its more "natural this way", works better with type inference and gives the opportunity for good discoverability via IDE autocomplete.

== Static Method for Query

[%linenums,java]
----
public interface Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> {}

public static  <TO_QUERY, RESULT> RESULT getOrThrow(TO_QUERY toQuery, Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query) {

}

public static Query<Nameable, String> name() {

}

static {

   Method method = null;

    String s = getOrThrow(method, name());
}
----
Here the direction is turned to `For this Object -> get the name`, but the discoverability can still be improved.

== A Query can be a Function

[%linenums,java]
----
public interface Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> extends Function<TO_QUERY, RESULT> {

   @Override
   public RESULT apply(TO_QUERY toQuery);
}

public static Query<Nameable, String> name() {

}

static
{
   Method method = null;

   String name = name().apply(method);
}
----
A Query is functionality equivalent to a `Function`.
If the `Query` is the "active" part its back to `get the name -> for this Object`

== Duplicate Model

[%linenums,java]
----
public static ReflectionNameableQueryable query(Nameable nameable) {

}

public static ReflectionMethodQueryable query(Method method) {

}

public interface NameableQueryable
{
   public String getName();
}

public interface MethodQueryable extends NameableQueryable
{
   Return getReturn();
}

static
{
   Method method = null;

   String name = query(method).getName();
}
----
We can just duplicate the model or subsets of it and use static factory methods to map from one to the other.
This offers the best possible discoverability.
The only downside is that implementing support e.g. reflection is comparative more work.
Which is not that big of a problem.


== Generic
[%linenums,java]
----
public interface Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT>
{
   public static <TO_QUERY extends T, T> Queryable<T> query(TO_QUERY toQuery)
   {
   }
}

public interface Queryable<TO_QUERY>
{
   <RESULT> RESULT getOrThrow(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);

   <RESULT> Optional<RESULT> get(Query<TO_QUERY, RESULT> query);
}

public static Query<Nameable, String> name() {}

static {

   Method method = null;

   //compiles
   Queryable<Nameable> query = Query.query(method);
   query.get(name());

   //compiles
   Optional<String> s = Query.<Method, Nameable>query(method).get(name());

   //doesn't compile
   Optional<String> s1 = Query.query(method).get(name());
}
----
Here `Query` has a static factory with generics that give flexibility for supertypes.
So could a `Query` for `Nameable` be applied to a `Method`, because `Method` extends `Nameable`.
The Query call has two parts.
First the Object to query gets wrapped in a `Queryable` which can be queried when the types match.
This works but, but type inference is not strong enough.
Making it annoying and unintuitive to use.

== Conclusion
- All are flexible
- Duplicate Model and Generic provide the best discoverability
- Duplicate Model has the lowest barrier of entry
